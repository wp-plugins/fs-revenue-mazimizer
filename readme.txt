Adds your Adsense or any other ads inside your content ( after the first or second paragraph ), enabling you to increase your revenue 10 times. 

== Description ==

Provide an interface to add Google Adsense ads after the first or the second paragraph. You can add not only Adsense ads but any ad or affiliate link you want your visitors to pay attention to. 

It is known that most visitors are fully ignoring Adsense ads from header, sidebar or footer. They are able to identify where the content is and go directly to it ignoring everything else. Placing ads in sidebars, header or footer will only make your website to look ugly. 

The solution is to place the advertisements where the visitors pay their full attention: in the content. It is true that they might get upset that their content is interrupted by the ad, but there is only a small price to pay to read quality articles. 

I have implemented this solution to my blogs and the revenue per thousand ad views was 10 times bigger for the ad placed after the first or the second paragraph than any other ad on sidebars, headers, footers or even before and after posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this in compliance with Google Adsense Terms of Service and Policies ? =

Google adsense allows ads to be placed inside the content. However, you should review Google Adsense Terms of Service and Policies to make sure that your content is good to place ads in it. Your google ads should not be associated with other images in your content, should not be placed along with pornographic content. Since the ads are added automatically, you must check that they do not end up to be displayed in a way that is not recommended by Google.

= Why the ads appear on a single post but not on the homepage ? =

If your theme contains a slider or any other feature that will use the_content function the ads won't be displayed on the homepage. We are working to fix this.
